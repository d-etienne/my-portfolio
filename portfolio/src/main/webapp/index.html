      <img src="/images/ProfileImage.jpg" width = "200" height = "250"/>
      <p>Hey, my name is Daijah Etienne, though I love thinking of myself as a beautifulNerdd. 
          I am currently a sophomore studying Computer Science with a minor in Integrated Digital Media at New York University. </p>
          I really enjoy being creative and am currently taking a journey into discovering how to combine
          my love for creativity with my interest in devloping code. This portfolio is meant to be a documentation of my journey and 
          I hope that you enjoy traveling through it with me.</p>
      <p> Best, BeautifulNerdd. </p>
